# practice

This is a practice readme form. This will help me practice using git bash as well as learn how to use VI, since that's something I've never done before.

Remember, "i" is insert mode. [esc] takes you out of this mode. This allows you to add text to a document.

A few other helpful commands to remember:

h - left one space
j - down one line
k - up one line
l - right one space

x - delete a character
u - undo
shift + u - redo everything you just undid
dw - delete a word
2dw, 3dw, etc - deletes 2, 3, or x words
dd - deletes a whole line
shift + d - deletes from cursor to end of line
/ - search (ex: /search searches for the word search)
:w - save and leave VI open
:q! - quits without saving
